== Configuring Line Jumps

=== Overview

Sometimes when two connections are intersecting it is hard to follow their route. This is why the control is able to render "line jumps" at the intersection point. There are several line jump types you can chose from. The line jumps are rendered on the top connection and are updated whenever a diagram item changes its bounds (position, size or both).

.Note:
[NOTE]
====
If there is no space to render the line jump on the top connection (for example when the two connections are intersecting very close to one of the ends of the top connection) it will be rendered on the bottom connection.
====

=== Property settings

The following table maps the desired line jump type to the link:{ApiPlatform}controls.charts.xamdiagram{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.charts.xamdiagram~connectionlinejumps.html[ConnectionLineJumps] property value.

|No line jumps are rendered and connections are just intersecting each other (default behavior).

|image:images/xamDiagram_LineJumps_Arc.png[]
|An arc is rendered at the connections' intersection point.

|A gap is rendered at the connections' intersection point.

|A square is rendered at the connections' intersection point.

=== Example

The following example demonstrates how to configure the xamDiagram control to render an Arc type line jumps:

[source,xaml]
---- 
<xamDiagram ConnectionLineJumps="Arc"> 
...
</xamDiagram>
