= Infragistics NuGet Package Sources

NuGet is a powerful ecosystem of tools and services. It was introduced in 2010 as an open source package manager for the Microsoft development platform including .NET. NuGet is the easiest way to improve and automate your development practices.

When you install a package via NuGet, it copies the library files to your solution and automatically updates your project. That means adding references, changing config files, replacing old version script files, etc.

Nuget has been included by default since Visual Studio 2012, and for more information on how to get going with it, read the official link:http://docs.nuget.org/ndocs/guides/install-nuget[Nuget documentation].

=== Adding a local package source

If you have the NuGet packages stored on your machine in some directory adding a package source that points to that directory is very easy.  In Visual Studio, select Tools -> NuGet Package Manager -> Package Manager Settings.
