{empty}3. Changed Scatter High Density series’ colors for min/max heat properties  

{empty}4. Changed Financial/Waterfall series’ colors for negative fill of their visuals  

{empty}5. Changed marker's thickness to 2px from 1px

{empty}6. Changed marker's fill to match the marker's outline for PointSeries, BubbleSeries, ScatterSeries, PolarScatterSeries 

Note, you can use set link:{DataChartLink}.MarkerFillMode.html[MarkerFillMode] property to Normal to undo this change

{empty}7. Compressed labelling for the TimeXAxis and OrdinalTimeXAxis 

{empty}8. New Marker Properties:

- link:{DataChartLink}.MarkerFillMode.html[MarkerFillMode] - Can be set to 'MatchMarkerOutline' so the marker depends on the outline
- link:{DataChartLink}.XamDomainChart{ApiProp}MarkerFillOpacity.html[MarkerFillOpacity] - Can be set to a value 0 to 1
- link:{DataChartLink}.XamDomainChart{ApiProp}MarkerOutlineMode.html[MarkerOutlineMode] - Can be set to 'MatchMarkerBrush' so the marker's outline depends on the fill brush color

{empty}9. New Series link:{DataChartLink}.XamDomainChart{ApiProp}OutlineMode.html[OutlineMode] Property:

Can be set to toggle the series outline visibility. Note, for Data Chart, the property is on the series

{empty}10. New Plot Area Margin Properties:

The link:{DataChartLink}.{DataChartName}{ApiProp}PlotAreaMargin.html[PlotAreaMargin] properties define the bleed over area introduced into the viewport when the chart is at the default zoom level. A common use case is to provide space between the axes and first/last data points. Note, the link:{DataChartLink}.{DataChartName}{ApiProp}ComputedPlotAreaMarginMode.html[ComputedPlotAreaMarginMode], listed below, will automatically set the margin when markers are enabled. The PlotAreaMargin is designed to specify a Thickness to provide to all four sides of the chart. The others are used to gauge each side, as `Double`, which are read-only. These new properties were added:

- link:{DataChartLink}.{DataChartName}{ApiProp}PlotAreaMargin.html[PlotAreaMargin]
- link:{DataChartLink}.{DataChartName}{ApiProp}PlotAreaMarginLeft.html[PlotAreaMarginLeft]
- link:{DataChartLink}.{DataChartName}{ApiProp}PlotAreaMarginTop.html[PlotAreaMarginTop]
- link:{DataChartLink}.{DataChartName}{ApiProp}PlotAreaMarginRight.html[PlotAreaMarginRight]
- link:{DataChartLink}.{DataChartName}{ApiProp}PlotAreaMarginBottom.html[PlotAreaMarginBottom]
- link:{DataChartLink}.{DataChartName}{ApiProp}ComputedPlotAreaMarginMode.html[ComputedPlotAreaMarginMode]

{empty}11. New Highlighting Properties

- link:{DataChartLink}.XamDomainChart{ApiProp}HighlightingBehavior.html[HighlightingBehavior] - Sets whether the series highlights depending on mouse position eg. directly over or nearest item
