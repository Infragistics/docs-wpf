= Location of Generic.xaml File

The default themes, also known as generic XAML files, contains all styles, templates, and brushes used to render all {ProductName} controls. You can use these themes as a base basis to create your own themes, or you can just pick a few specific styles and modify them in your application.

The default theme files are available publicly in our link:https://github.com/Infragistics/wpf-resources/tree/main/DefaultStyles[WPF Resources GitHub repository].
