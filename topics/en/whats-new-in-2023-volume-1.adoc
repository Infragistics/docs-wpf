=== xamToolbar [ Beta ]

The link:xamtoolbar.html[xamToolbar] component is a companion container for UI operations to interact both standalone or with the Data Chart & `CategoryChart` components. This allows you to easily choose from a preset of properites on the eg. `XamDataChart` with predefined SVG icons, but it also gives you the ability to create custom tools for your project. Benefiting from a number of attributes, you can define or change the icon in use or apply different actions to it. The `Toolbar` will display it's own SVG icons.

=== Chart Dash Array

The series in the link:{DataChartLink}.{DataChartName}.html[{DataChartName}] now support the ability to apply a `DashArray` to them to visualize them as a dashed line. The dash array can also be applied to the trendlines of the series via the `TrendLineDashArray` property.

In addition to this, the axes support dash arrays for the axis lines and the major and minor gridlines of the axis. This is done via the `StrokeDashArray`, `MajorStrokeDashArray`, `MinorStrokeDashArray` properties of the axes, respectively.

The following documentation describes the various dash arrays that you can apply to the link:{DataChartLink}.{DataChartName}.html[{DataChartName}]:

- link:datachart-category-line-series#DashArray.html[Line Series Dash Array]
- link:datachart-trend-lines.html[Trendlines Dash Array]

=== Chart Value Layer

A new series type named the link:{DataChartLink}.valuelayer.html[ValueLayer] is now available which allows you to render an overlay for different focal points of the plotted data such as Maximum, Minimum, and Average. This is rendered as a dashed line in the plot area of the chart.

This series type is applied in the link:{CategoryChartLink}.{CategoryChartName}.html[{CategoryChartName}] and the link:{FinancialChartLink}.{FinancialChartName}.html[{FinancialChartName}] by adding to the `ValueLines` collection on those chart types.

The following topic reviews this new series type in more detail:
