=== .NET Core 3.1 Support

A new environment to use Infragistics controls is now available! As of version 2020.1, our assemblies now have support for the .NET Core 3.1 environment through NuGet.

For some advantages of .NET Core 3.1, see link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-core-3-1[this article on Microsoft's site].

You can read about configuring your environment to use Infragistics NuGet packages at our link:nuget-feeds.html[NuGet Feed] and link:nuget-packages.html[NuGet Packages] topics.
