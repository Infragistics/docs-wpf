[[Ref_25_2_45]]

== 25.2.45 (November 2025)

=== .NET 10 Support

As of version 2025.2, the Ultimate UI for WPF toolset supports .NET 10. For more information on .NET 10 please refer to link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-10/overview[this article on Microsoft's site].

For more details please visit link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/microsoft-net-and-net-core[Microsoft .NET lifecycle].

Note we no longer support .NET 6 and .NET 7.

=== Azure Map Imagery is now RTM
 
=== New Chart Features

==== Collision Detection for Axis annotations (Beta)

Ability for axis annotations to automatically detect collisions and truncate to fit better. To enable this feature you must set the following properties:

- `ShouldAvoidAnnotationCollisions`
- `ShouldAutoTruncateAnnotations`

==== User Annotations Layer (Beta)

In {ProductName}, you can now annotate the `{DataChartName}` with slice, strip, and point annotations at runtime using the new user annotations feature. This allows the end user to add more details to the plot such as calling out single important events such as company quarter reports by using the slice annotation or events that have a duration by using the strip annotation. You can also call out individual points on the plotted series by using the point annotation or any combination of these three.

This is directly integrated with the available tools of the `XamToolbar`.

[[Ref_25_1_117]]

== 25.1.117 (October 2025)

=== Azure Map Imagery Support for XamGeographicMap (Beta)

The `XamGeographicMap` now supports Azure-based map imagery, allowing developers to display detailed, dynamic maps across multiple application types. You can combine multiple map layers, visualize geographic data, and create interactive mapping experiences with ease.

Note: Support for Bing Maps imagery is being phased out. Existing enterprise keys can still be used to access Bing Maps, ensuring your current applications continue to function while you transition to Azure maps.

Explore some of the publicly available Azure maps here: link:https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/azure-maps[Azure
 Maps].

image::https://static.infragistics.com/xplatform/images/browsers/azure-maps/azure-gif-main.gif[Azure Maps in action, width=600, align=center, link=""]

=== New Axis Label Events for XamDataChart (Beta)

The following events have been added to the `XamDataChart` to allow you to detect different operations on the axis labels:

- `LabelMouseDown`
- `LabelMouseUp`
- `LabelMouseEnter`
- `LabelMouseLeave`
- `LabelMouseMove`
- `LabelMouseClick`

=== Companion Axis for Charts (Beta)

We have added `CompanionAxis` properties to the X and Y axis that allow you to quickly create a clone of an existing axis. When enabled using the `CompanionAxisEnabled` property, this will default the cloned axis to the opposite position of the chart and you can then configure that axes' properties.

=== RadialPieSeries Inset Outlines (Beta)

We have added a new property called `UseInsetOutlines` to control how outlines on the `RadialPieSeries` are rendered. Setting this value to `true` will inset the outlines within the slice shape, whereas a `false` (default) value will place the outlines half-in half-out along the edge of the slice shape.

=== Enhancements

==== XamBulletGraph

- Added new `LabelsVisible` property (Beta)

==== Charts

- New properties added to the DataToolTipLayer, ItemToolTipLayer, and CategoryToolTipLayer to aid in styling: `ToolTipBackground`, `ToolTipBorderBrush`, and `ToolTipBorderThickness` (Beta)

- New properties added to the DataLegend to aid in styling: `ContentBackground`, `ContentBorderBrush`, and `ContentBorderThickness`. Note, you can still style the DataLegend using previously existing `Background`, `BorderBrush`, and `BorderThickness` properties, but these new properties will take precedence. Both of these related `BorderBrush` and `BorderThickness` default to transparent and 0 respectively, so to see these borders, you will need to set these properties.

- Added a new property to `ChartMouseEventArgs` called `WorldPosition` that provides the world relative position of the mouse. This position will be a value between 0 and 1 for both the X and Y axis within the axis space.

- Added `HighlightingFadeOpacity` to `SeriesViewer` and `DomainChart`. This allows you to configure the opacity applied to highlighted series.

- Expose `CalloutLabelUpdating` event for domain charts.


==== XamLinearGauge

- Added new `LabelsVisible` property (Beta)

[[BC_25_1_117]]
== Breaking Changes

=== XamDataChart
The `IsSquare` property is now internal. This property is designed for use with polar and radial series, where maintaining a square plotting area is necessary for correct rendering. Using it with other series types could lead to distorted or unsatisfactory layouts, therefore we decided that it was best to omit this. To achieve a similar visual effect, measure the chart’s `ViewPortRect` and adjust the chart’s width and height to maintain an appropriate aspect ratio.

- link:datachart-data-legend.html[Data Legend]
- link:datachart-data-tooltip.html[Data ToolTip]

=== Drag Selection (Beta)

There is a new enumeration for the `DefaultInteraction` property on the chart named `DragSelect`. This will use the preview Rect of the chart to select points of a series.

=== Overlay Text (Beta)

The following series types now support overlaying text for additional annotation in the chart by using the new `OverlayText` property:

- link:{DataChartLink}.ValueLayer.html[ValueLayer]
- link:{DataChartLink}.ValueOverlay.html[ValueOverlay]

In addition to to the series types mentioned, the new data annotation layers listed above also support this feature.

You can configure how this overlay text appears in aspects such as angle, color, background, padding, margin, font, etc. by using the many OverlayText-prefixed properties. For example, `OverlayTextBrush` will configure the color.

=== Trendline Layer

The `TrendlineLayer` is a new series type that allows you to apply a single trend line per trend line layer to a particular series. This allows the usage of multiple trend lines on a single series since you can have multiple `TrendlineLayer` series types in the chart.

=== XamDashboardTile Aggregation Support

The `XamDashboardTile` now supports propagating the aggregations from its DataGrid view to the chart visualization such as sorting, grouping, filtering and selection. 

This is currently supported by binding the `ItemsSource` of the `XamDashboardTile` to an instance of `LocalDataSource`.

=== Enhancements

==== XamToolbar
- Value layers added from the `XamToolbar` now appear on the Legend.
- The zoom reset tool has been moved to the zoom drop-down.

==== XamDataPieChart

- The chart now exposes a `GetOthersContext()` method. This will return the contents of the others slice.

[[Ref_24_1_20]]
== 24.1.20 (August 2024)

=== {DataPieChartName}

The link:{DataPieChartLink}.{DataPieChartName}.html[{DataPieChartName}] is a new component that renders a pie chart. This component works similarly to the link:{CategoryChartLink}.{CategoryChartName}.html[{CategoryChartName}], in that it will automatically detect the properties on your underlying data model while allowing selection, highlighting, animation and legend support via the ItemLegend component.

The full documentation for the link:{DataPieChartLink}.{DataPieChartName}.html[{DataPieChartName}] can be found using the link below:

- link:data-pie-chart.html[{DataPieChartName}].

=== Data Legend & Data Tooltip Grouping

New link:{DataChartLink}.{DataChartName}.html[{DataChartName}] grouping feature added. The property `GroupRowVisible` toggles grouping with each series opting in can assign group text via the `DataLegendGroup` property. If the same value is applied to more than one series then they will appear grouped. Useful for large datasets that need to be categorized and organized for all users.

=== Chart Selection

New series selection. This is adopted broadly across all category, financial and radial series for link:{CategoryChartLink}.{CategoryChartName}.html[{CategoryChartName}] and link:{DataChartLink}.{DataChartName}.html[{DataChartName}]. Series can be clicked and shown a different color, brightened or faded, and focus outlines. The colors can be modified via the `SelectionBrush` and FocusBrush` properties. Manage which items are effected through individual series or entire data item. Multiple series and markers are supported. Useful for illustrating various differences or similarities between values of a partcular dataitem. Also  `SelectedSeriesItemsChanged` event and `SelectedSeriesItems` are available for additional help to build out robust business requirements surrouding other actions that can take place within an application such as a popup or other screen with data analysis based on the selection. In addition, you can read the selected items via the `SelectedSeriesItems` collection.

=== Proportional Category Angle Axis

New axes for the Radial Pie Series in the link:{DataChartLink}.{DataChartName}.html[{DataChartName}], to enable creating pie charts in the allowing robust visualizations using all the added power of the data chart.

=== Radial Gauge properties

New label for the highlight needle. `HighlightLabelText` and `HighlightLabelSnapsToNeedlePivot` and many other styling related properties for the HighlightLabel were added.

=== Toolbar 

New IsHighlighted option for ToolAction for outlining a border around specific tools of choice.

[[BC_24_1_20]]
== Breaking Changes

=== Radial/Polar series
The plot area for polar and radial series is now expanded to fill the entire chart space and is no longer forced to be square, this allows for labels to expand into the bleed area.

[[Ref_23_2_157]]
== 23.2.157 (April Release)

=== Funnel Chart Highlighting

As of the 23.2 April release, the link:{FunnelChartLink}.{FunnelChartName}.html[{FunnelChartName}] has a highlighting overlay. It exposes this overlay through multiple highlighting properties, namely `HighlightedItemsSource`, `HighlightValueDisplayMode`, `HighlightedValueMemberPath`, and `HighlightingOpacity`.

When the `HighlightValueDisplayMode` is set to `Overlay`, this works in tandem with the `HighlightedItemsSource` and `HighlightedValueMemberPath` to provide a highlighted overlay the displays the difference between the values in the chart's `ItemsSource` and the `HighlightedItemsSource`. You can control the opacity of the highlight overlay with the `HighlightingOpacity` property.

=== Gauge Highlighting Features

The link:{RadialGaugeLink}.{RadialGaugeName}.html[{RadialGaugeName}], link:{LinearGaugeLink}.{LinearGaugeName}.html[{LinearGaugeName}], and link:{BulletGraphLink}.{BulletGraphName}.html[{BulletGraphName}] now expose `HighlightValue` and `HighlightValueDisplayMode` properties.

In the `{RadialGaugeName}` and `{LinearGaugeName}`, when provided a value and a `HighlightValueDisplayMode` of `Overlay`, this will make the main needle appear faded and an additional needle will appear.

In the `{BulletGraphName}`, the performance bar will now reflect a difference between the value and the `HighlightValue` when the `HighlightValueDisplayMode` is set to `Overlay`. The highlighted value will show a filtered/subset measured percentage as a filled-in color while the remaining bar's appearance will be faded to the assigned value.

=== Radial Chart Label Mode

The `CategoryAngleAxis` for the link:{DataChartLink}.{DataChartName}.html[{DataChartName}] now exposes a `LabelMode` property that allows you to further configure the location of the labels. This allows you to toggle between the default mode by selecting the `Center` enum, or use the new mode, `ClosestPoint`, which will bring the labels closer to the circular plot area.

=== Radial Gauge Optical Scaling

The link:{RadialGaugeLink}.{RadialGaugeName}.html[{RadialGaugeName}] now has the ability to change its scaling for its labels, subtitle and title. This is done by setting the `OpticalScalingEnabled` property to true. Then, you can set the `OpticalScalingSize` which manages the size at which labels have 100% optical scaling. Essentially, labels will have larger fonts when the gauge's size is larger.

For example, labels will have a 200% larger font size when this property is set to 500 and the gauge size is 1000.

=== Radial Gauge Title and Subtitle

New title and subtitle properties for the link:{RadialGaugeLink}.{RadialGaugeName}.html[{RadialGaugeName}] are now available. `TitleText` and `SubtitleText` will show the corresponding title near the bottom the gauge. In addition, various title and subtitle font properties were added such as `TitleFontSize`, `TitleFontFamily`, `TitleFontStyle`, `TitleFontWeight` and `TitleExtent`. Finally, the new `TitleDisplaysValue` will allow the value to correspond with the needle's position.

== 23.2 (2023 Release) 

=== .NET 8.0 support

As of version 2023.2, the Ultimate UI for WPF toolset supports .NET 8. For more information on .NET 8 please refer to link:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-8[this article on Microsoft's site].

=== Chart Highlight Filter

The link:{CategoryChartLink}.{CategoryChartName}.html[{CategoryChartName}] and link:{DataChartLink}.{DataChartName}.html[{DataChartName}] now expose a way to highlight and animate in and out of a subset of data. The display of this highlight depends on the series type. For column and area series, the subset will be shown on top of the total set of data where the subset will be colored by the actual brush of the series, and the total set will have a reduced opacity. For line series, the subset will be shown as a dotted line.

image:images/chart-highlight-filter.png[]

This feature includes a new filter syntax that is OData-like that you can use with the link:{CategoryChartLink}.{CategoryChartName}.html[{CategoryChartName}].

The following documentation describes the various ways that you can apply the highlight filter to the chart controls.

- link:datachart-highlight-filter.html[{DataChartName} Highlight Filter]
- link:categorychart-highlight-filter.html[{CategoryChartName} Highlight Filter]
