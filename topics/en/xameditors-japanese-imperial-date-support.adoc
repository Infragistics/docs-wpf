== Japanese Imperial Date Support

=== Overview

Besides the Gregorian calendar's date format, the control can also be configured to use the Japanese calendar's date format in which the year is represented by an Era and the year of this Era.

The following table compares the two input date formats side by side:

[options="header", cols="a,a"]

|Gregorian Calendar
|Japanese Calendar

=== Setting the Japanese Calendar

The following code snippet demonstrates how to set the Japanese calendar:

*In C#:*
[source,csharp]
----
CultureInfo ci = new CultureInfo("ja-JP");
Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture = ci;
Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture = ci;

ci.DateTimeFormat.Calendar = new JapaneseCalendar();
this.xamDateTimeEditor1.FormatProvider = ci;

this.xamDateTimeEditor1.Language =
    XmlLanguage.GetLanguage(ci.IetfLanguageTag);
----

When the Japanese calendar is used the year is no longer represented in the Western format, but as an Era and the year of this Era. When the control is in edit mode and the cursor is in the Era field the user may select a specific Era using the keyboard shortcuts in the following table:

[options="header", cols="30a,30a,30a"]
|====
|Era (Japanese)|Reign Start Date|Keyboard shortcut
|Meiji ( 明治 )|1868 / Sep / 08|*M*, *m* or *1*
|Taishō ( 大正 )|1912 / Jul / 30|*T*, *t* or *2*
|Shōwa ( 昭和 )|1926 / Dec / 25|*S*, *s* or *3*
|Heisei ( 平成 )|1989 / Jan / 08|*H*, *h* or *4*
