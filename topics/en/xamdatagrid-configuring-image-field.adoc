[[ImageFieldConfig]]
== Image Field Configuration Summary

An ImageField can be associated with a property on an underlying data item whose value represents any of the following types:

* An ImageSource instance.
* A Uri instance that describes the location of a local or remote image resource.
* A string that represents a properly formatted Uri that describes the location of a local or remote image resource.
* A byte array (byte[]) that represents a BitmapImage.

The ImageField's associated editor is an element of the type ImageEditor. This editor is always read-only and was designed to render images. As such, it can never enter edit mode.

The following table briefly details the configurable aspects and properties of the ImageField that control the way the image is rendered:

[options="header", cols="a,a,a"]
|====
|Property Name|Property Type|Description

|link:{DataGridLink}.imagefield{ApiProp}BaseUri.html[BaseUri]
|`Uri`
|Gets or sets the base Uri to use for locating the image.  This value will be used to construct a fully resolved Uri when a cell's bound data contains a Uri or UriString.

|link:{DataGridLink}.imagefield{ApiProp}ImageHeight.html[ImageHeight]
|`double`
|Returns or sets the height that the editor should use to render the image.  If set to double.NaN (the default value) the image will be rendered using its intrinsic height.


|link:{DataGridLink}.imagefield{ApiProp}ImageWidth.html[ImageWidth]
|`double`
|Returns or sets the width that the editor should use to render the image.  If set to double.NaN (the default value) the image will be rendered using its intrinsic width.

|link:{DataGridLink}.imagefield{ApiProp}Stretch.html[Stretch]
|`Stretch`
|Returns or sets a value that describes how the rendered image should be stretched to fill the destination rectangle.

|link:{DataGridLink}.imagefield{ApiProp}StretchDirection.html[StretchDirection]
|`StretchDirection`
|Returns or sets a value that indicates how the rendered image is scaled.

[[CodeExample]]
== Code Example: Using an Image Field

The screenshot below demonstrates how the ImageField would look as a result of the following code example.

image:images/XamDataGrid_Image_Field.png[]

The following is the code to implement the ImageField in the {DataGridName}, where "Photo" is a property of one of the types listed above in the underlying data item.

*In XAML:*
[source,xaml]
----
<igDP:ImageField Name="Photo" ImageHeight="100" ImageWidth="100" />
----
