=== .NET Core 3 Support

A new environment to use Infragistics controls is now available! As of version 2019.1, our assemblies now have support for the .NET Core 3.0 environment through NuGet.

On release, we will be supporting the release candidate version for .NET Core 3.0, but we will be synchronizing our environment with Microsoft's release schedule so that we will support the full release of .NET Core 3.0 when it releases. For some advantages of .NET Core 3.0, see link:https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/mt848631.aspx[this article on Microsoft's site].

You can read about configuring your environment to use Infragistics NuGet packages at our link:nuget-feeds.html[NuGet Feed] and link:nuget-packages.html[NuGet Packages] topics.

In addition, the chart adapters are complemented by our Excel Engine, where link:excelengine-workingwithcharts.html[chart support was added in volume 18.2]. 

There are over 35 chart types supported by the Spreadsheet ChartAdapters including, Line, Area, Column, and Doughnut.
