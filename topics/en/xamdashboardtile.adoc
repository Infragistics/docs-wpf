= XamDashboardTile [Beta]

The `XamDashboardTile` component is a container control that visualizes an ItemsSource collection or single data point by generating a data visualization control from the {ProductName} toolset based on the schema of that data. It also uses the `XamToolbar` to further interact with and customize these data visualization controls.

== Requirements

The following are requirements to adding the `XamDashboardTile` to the page.

* Add the following NuGet package to your WPF application.
** Infragistics.WPF.Dashboards

For more information on setting up the NuGet feed and adding NuGet packages, you can take a look at the following documentation: link:nuget-feeds.html[NuGet Feeds]:

* After adding the NuGet package, you need to register the following Feature elements so that the different visualizations used by the `XamDashboardTile` can be initialized and used. You can do this by placing the following code prior to the InitializeComponent() call in the constructor of your WPF page:

**In C#**
[source,csharp]
----
using Infragistics.Controls.Dashboards;

public MainWindow()
{
    DataChartDashboardTileFeature.Register();
    GeographicMapDashboardTileFeature.Register();
    LinearGaugeDashboardTileFeature.Register();
    RadialGaugeDashboardTileFeature.Register();
    PieChartDashboardTileFeature.Register();

    InitializeComponent();
}
----

== Adding the XamDashboardTile

Once the requirements listed above are complete, you can add the `XamDashboardTile` to your page. To do this, first define the following XAML namespace:

**In XAML**
[source,xaml]
----
xmlns:ig="http://schemas.infragistics.com/xaml"
----

After the namespace is defined, you can add the control to the page and bind the ItemsSource property to a value in your view model. This property can be a collection of values or a single value.

**In XAML**
[source, xaml]
----
<ig:XamDashboardTile ItemsSource="{Binding Data}" />
----

=== Usage

Depending on what you bind the `XamDashboardTile` ItemsSource property to will determine which visualization you see by default, as the control will evaluate the data you bind and then choose a visualization from the {ProductName} toolset to show. The data visualization controls that are included to be shown in the `XamDashboardTile` are the following:

* link:categorychart-overview.html[XamCategoryChart]
* link:datachart-datachart.html[XamDataChart]
* link:data-pie-chart.html[XamDataPieChart]
* link:geographicmap.html[XamGeographicMap]
* link:lineargauge.html[XamLinearGauge]
* link:radialgauge.html[XamRadialGauge]

The data visualization that is chosen by default is mainly dependent on the schema and the count of the ItemsSource that you have bound. For example, if you bind a single numeric value, you will get a `XamRadialGauge`, but if you bind a collection of value-label pairs that are not too close to each other, you will get a `XamDataPieChart`. If you bind an ItemsSource that has more value paths, you will receive a `XamCategoryChart` or `XamDataChart` with multiple column series or line series, depending mainly on the count of the collection bound. You can also bind to a `ShapeDataSource` to receive a `XamGeographicMap`.

You are not locked into a single visualization when you bind the ItemsSource, and you can tell the control that you want to see a particular visualization by setting its `VisualizationType` property. For example, if you specifically wanted to see a line chart, you could define the `XamDashboardTile` like so:

**In XAML**
[source,xaml]
----
<ig:XamDashboardTile x:Name="dashboardTile" ItemsSource="{Binding Data}" VisualizationType="LineChart" />
----

**In C#**
[source,csharp]
----
dashboardTile.VisualizationType = DashboardTileVisualizationType.LineChart;
----

The visualization or properties of the visualization are also configurable using the `XamToolbar` at the top of the control. This `XamToolbar` has the default tools for the current visualization with the addition of four `XamDashboardTile` specific ones, highlighted below:

From left to right:

- The first tool will show a data grid with the ItemsSource provided to the control. This is a toggle tool, so if you click it again after showing the grid, it will revert to the visualization.
- The second tool allows you to configure the properties of the current data visualization.
- The third tool allows you to change the current visualization entirely. This can be set on the control by setting the `VisualizationType` property, mentioned above.
- The last tool allows you to configure which properties on your underlying data item are included for the control. You can configure this by setting the `IncludedProperties` or `ExcludedProperties` collection on the control.
