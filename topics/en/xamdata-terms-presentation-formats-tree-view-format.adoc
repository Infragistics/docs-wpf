= Tree View

Tree View expresses your data in the form of a table, containing regular columns and rows because it has a view extending from the  link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter{ApiVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.gridviewbase.html[GridViewBase] (like the Grid View). However, the Tree View has a special "tree-field" which contains a tree representation of the hierarchical data bound to the control. The user has the ability to browse through the nested records' levels by expanding and collapsing them using the designated expansion indicators.

The following screenshot shows a Tree View displaying hierarchical structure of records with the tree positioned in the "Name" field. The "Name" field in this example is using a custom template for the link:{ApiPlatform}datapresenter{ApiVersion}~infragistics.windows.datapresenter.treecellvaluepresenter.html[TreeCellValuePresenter] which displays an image for each record:
