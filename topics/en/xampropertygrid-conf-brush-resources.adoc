=== Overview

When scrolling the properties list the property editors are constantly coming in and out of view. When a brush type property editor is coming into view the link:{ApiPlatform}controls.editors.xampropertygrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.editors.xampropertygrid~brushresourcesloading_ev.html[BrushResourcesLoading] event is raised. You have the ability to customize the brush editor's user interface in the event's handler using the event arguments object of type link:{ApiPlatform}controls.editors.xampropertygrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.editors.brushresourceseventargs.html[BrushResourcesEventArgs]. This arguments object also include a reference to the link:{ApiPlatform}controls.editors.xampropertygrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.editors.propertygridpropertyitem.html[PropertyGridPropertyItem] associated with the brush property coming into view.

=== Customizing Brush Resources

image:images/xamPropertyGrid_Brush_Resources.png[] +

As visible on the picture above the brush resources panel divides the brushes in two groups – "Local Brush Resources" and "System Brush Resources". You can customize the brush entries in these groups by either adding your own brush definitions and/or including the system brushes.

To include the system brushes you need to set the link:{ApiPlatform}controls.editors.xampropertygrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.editors.brushresourceseventargs~automaticallyincludesystembrushresources.html[AutomaticallyIncludeSystemBrushResources] boolean property to true and this will include all colors from the current Windows theme in the "System Brush Resources" group.

To add your own brushes to one of these two groups use the link:{ApiPlatform}controls.editors.xampropertygrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.editors.brushresourceseventargs~brushresources.html[BrushResources] property and add objects of type link:{ApiPlatform}controls.editors.xampropertygrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.editors.primitives.propertygridbrushresourceitem.html[PropertyGridBrushResourceItem]. This type contains all information related to the brush resource entry – the brush itself, the brush name, the brush group and a Tag property of type object used to store arbitrary information.

.Note
[NOTE]
====
If you do not add brush resources items to the `BrushResources` property and you do not set the `AutomaticallyIncludeSystemBrushResources` property to true, the button for showing the brush resources panel will not be visible.

=== Get Notified When a Brush is Selected

When the user selects a brush entry from the brush resources list a link:{ApiPlatform}controls.editors.xampropertygrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.editors.xampropertygrid~BrushResourceSelected_EV.html[BrushResourceSelected] event is raised. The event arguments object of this event provides the following properties:

* link:{ApiPlatform}controls.editors.xampropertygrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.editors.BrushResourceEventArgs~PropertyItem.html[PropertyItem] – this property of type `PropertyGridPropertyItem` is associated with the brush property whose brush has changed.

* link:{ApiPlatform}controls.editors.xampropertygrid{ApiVersion}~infragistics.controls.editors.BrushResourceEventArgs~BrushResource.html[BrushResource] – this property of type `PropertyGridBrushResourceItem` comprises all information related to the selected brush entry.
