# Infragistics Docs for WPF Components
 
Welcome to the help topics repository for [Infragistics WPF](https://www.infragistics.com/help/wpf/) components. By interacting with the content in this repository, you can learn how to use these components. Also you have an opportunity to interface directly with the Infragistics product teams to help build better product documentation. Pull requests, comments and issues are all welcome!

## Docs Organization

Most topics in this help documentation can be found in the [topics/en](./topics/en/) folder. While this can make for a long list of files, this flat structure makes it easy to find files by name.

The best way to find the file you are looking for is to navigate to a page on the [Infragistics WPF](https://www.infragistics.com/help/wpf/) help and pull the file name from the page's URL. If for some reason you are not able to locate the file name in this repository, then you are likely seeking a shared topic and need to look in the [docs-common](https://github.com/Infragistics/docs-common) repository. 

## Shared Repository
